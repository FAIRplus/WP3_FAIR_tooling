OLS,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/obi,"The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) is build in a collaborative, international effort and will serve as a resource for annotating biomedical investigations, including the study design, protocols and instrumentation used, the data generated and the types of analysis performed on the data. This ontology arose from the Functional Genomics Investigation Ontology (FuGO) and will contain both terms that are common to all biomedical investigations, including functional genomics investigations and those that are more domain specific."
OXO,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/oxo/,"OxO is a service for finding mappings (or cross-references) between terms from ontologies, vocabularies and coding standards. OxO imports mappings from a variety of sources including the Ontology Lookup Service and a subset of mappings provided by the UMLS. We're still developing the service so please get in touch if you have any feedback."
Zooma,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/zooma/,"Zooma is a tool for mapping free text annotations to ontology term based on a curated repository of annotation knowledge.

Where mappings are not found in the curated respository one or more ontologies can be selected from the Ontology Lookup Service to increase coverage. For example if you want to map GWAS annotations select the GWAS datasource and a common disease ontology such as EFO or DOID to maximise coverage when terms have no curated mappings.

Use the text box to find possible ontology mappings for free text terms in the ZOOMA repository of curated annotation knowledge. You can add one term (e.g. 'Homo sapiens') per line. If you also have a type for your term (e.g. 'organism'), put this after the term, separated by a tab.
If you are new to ZOOMA, take a look at our getting started guide."
NCBO Bioportal,https://bioportal.bioontology.org/,"The goal of the National Center for Biomedical Ontology is to support biomedical researchers in their knowledge-intensive work, by providing online tools and a Web portal enabling them to access, review, and integrate disparate ontological resources in all aspects of biomedical investigation and clinical practice. A major focus of our work involves the use of biomedical ontologies to aid in the management and analysis of data derived from complex experiments.

OBO foundry,http://www.obofoundry.org/,"The mission of the OBO Foundry is to develop a family of interoperable ontologies that are both logically well-formed and scientifically accurate. To achieve this, OBO Foundry participants follow and contribute to the development of an evolving set of principles including open use, collaborative development, non-overlapping and strictly-scoped content, and common syntax and relations, based on ontology models that work well, such as the Operations Committee with Editorial, Technical and Outreach working groups."

NCBO bioportal Annotator,https://bioportal.bioontology.org/annotator,"The range of publicly available biomedical data is enormous and continues to rapidly expand. This expansion means that researchers now face a hurdle to extracting the data they need from the large numbers of data that are available. Biomedical researchers have turned to ontologies and terminologies to structure and annotate their data with ontology concepts for better search and retrieval. However, this annotation process cannot be easily automated and often requires expert curators. Plus, there is a lack of easy-to-use systems that facilitate the use of ontologies for annotation. The NCBO Annotator (formerly referred to as the Open Biomedical Annotator (OBA)) is an ontology-based Web service that annotates public datasets with biomedical ontology concepts based on their textual metadata. The biomedical community can use the annotator service to tag their data automatically with ontology concepts. These concepts come from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) BioPortal ontologies. Such annotations facilitate translational discoveries by integrating annotated data."
