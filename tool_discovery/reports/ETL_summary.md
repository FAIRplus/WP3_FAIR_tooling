Data Extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) is the process of collecting data from one source to a desinated system in which the data is represented differently.[1]

(Define the FAIRplus ETL based on [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1loEoROKxxh2gYEtXSiA0ziJjkTGJ2MYw3Xgzt1Z9JeI/edit#gid=0) focus on identifying tools for data content extraction and harmonisation. Extracting data from different sources and transforming it into a cohesive dataset.Scalable and portable ETL systems/processes to support data exchange with different validation and transform rules in both local and cloud servers
Build a scalable ETL system/process to surpport data exchange with different validation and transform rules. 

Our use case is ([Karsten's use case](https://github.com/FAIRplus/WP3_FAIR_tooling/issues/30)) We have identified a data set (maybe internally or externally) that we would like to import into our larger repository.
