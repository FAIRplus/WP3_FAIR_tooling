| [PPR-SSM](https://bio.tools/PPR-SSM)           | Personalized PageRank and semantic similarity measures for entity linking.<br>BACKGROUND:Biomedical literature concerns a wide range of concepts, requiring controlled vocabularies to maintain a consistent terminology across different research groups. However, as new concepts are introduced, biomedical literature is prone to ambiguity, specifically in fields that are advancing more rapidly, for example, drug design and development. Entity linking is a text mining task that aims at linking entities mentioned in the literature to concepts in a knowledge base. For example, entity linking can help finding all documents that mention the same concept and improve relation extraction methods. Existing approaches focus on the local similarity of each entity and the global coherence of all entities in a document, but do not take into account the semantics of the domain. RESULTS:We propose a method, PPR-SSM, to link entities found in documents to concepts from domain-specific ontologies. | <ul><li>Ontology and terminology</li></ul> | <ul><li>Relation extraction</li></ul>          | <ul></ul>                           |            |

The NLP engine analyzes the input free-text query and translates it into targeted queries with terms from the underlying ontology. Each query is passed to the semantically-annotated tools repository, and based on similarity matches, it ranks the available resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | <ul><li>Medical informatics</li></ul>      | <ul><li>Service discovery</li></ul>            | <ul><li>Web application</li></ul>   |            |
