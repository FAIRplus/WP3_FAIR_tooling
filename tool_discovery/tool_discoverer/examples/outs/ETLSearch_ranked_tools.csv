FAIRifier,0.650,"A general-purpose FAIRifier on the basis of the OpenRefine data cleaning and wrangling tool and the RDF plugin. This FAIRifier enables a post-hoc FAIRification workflow: load an existing dataset, perform data wrangling tasks, add FAIR attributes to the data, generate a linked data version of the data and, finally, push the result to an online FAIR data infrastructure to make it accessible and discoverable. Literal values in a dataset can be replaced by identifiers either manually or by embedded, customizable script expressions. The interoperability of the dataset can be improved by connecting these identifiers into a meaningful semantic graph-structure of ontological classes and properties using the integrated RDF model editor. A provenance trail automatically keeps track of each modification and additionally enables “undo” operations and repetition of operations on similar datasets.

In spite of the large-scale production and widespread distribution of vaccines and antiviral drugs, viruses remain a prominent human disease. Recently, the discovery of antiviral peptides (AVPs) has become an influential antiviral agent due to their extraordinary advantages. With the avalanche of newly-found peptide sequences in the post-genomic era, there is a great demand to develop a sequence-based predictor for timely identifying AVPs as this information is very useful for both basic research and drug development. In this study, we propose a novel sequence-based meta-predictor with an effective feature representation, called Meta-iAVP, for the accurate prediction of AVPs from given peptide sequences.

For a query sequence, TripletRes starts with the collection of deep multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) through whole-genome and metagenome sequence databases. Next, three complimentary coevolutionay feature matrices (covariance martrix, precision matrix and the pseudolikelihood maximization) extracted from the MSAs are used to create contact-map models through deep residual convolutional neural network training.","['Metagenomics', 'Machine learning', 'Structure prediction', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'Protein folds and structural domains']","['Protein folding analysis', 'Ab initio structure prediction', 'Fold recognition', 'Residue contact prediction', 'Contact map calculation']",[],[],[],0.0,,tripletres,,4511.0,1862.0,3451.4

Overall, the analysis of large, complex, microscopy images is hence still a critical bottleneck for many Life Scientists.

SUMMARY Genome-wide CRISPR screens are an effective discovery tool for genes that underlie diverse cellular mechanisms that can be scored through cell fitness. Loss-of-function screens are particularly challenging compared to gain-of-function because of the limited dynamic range of decreased sgRNA sequence detection. Here we describe G uide- O nly control CRISPR (GO-CRISPR), an improved loss-of-function screening workflow, and its companion software package, T oolset for the R anked A nalysis of GO- C RISPR S creens (TRACS). We demonstrate a typical GO-CRISPR workflow in a non-proliferative 3D spheroid model of dormant high grade serous ovarian cancer and demonstrate superior performance to standard screening methods

We used the Lasso Cox regression model to identify independent risk factors for long-term survival and to develop a predictive nomogram for survival and a web-based survival rate calculator.

Discovery of novel antibacterial agents is the high-priority task because the existing therapy do not provide the necessary safety and sufficient long-term efficacy due to the emerging resistance [1]. The process may be optimized using (Q)SAR methods based on the accumulated experimental data in the field.

Nowadays, data on antibacterial action of chemical compounds are well represented in public domain. ChEMBL database [2], for example, contains records on activity of chemical compounds against 1386 bacteria. We extracted bioactivity records on minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chemical compounds from ChEMBL_24 and prepared them as follows:.

To address this biological issue, several in silico studies have been done to identify and classify enhancer sequences among a myriad of DNA sequences using computational advances. Although recent studies have come up with improved performance, shortfalls in these learning models still remain. To overcome limitations of existing learning models, we introduce iEnhancer-ECNN, an efficient prediction framework using one-hot encoding and k-mers for data transformation and ensembles of convolutional neural networks for model construction, to identify enhancers and classify their strength.","['DNA', 'Epigenomics', 'Proteomics', 'Machine learning', 'Gene expression']",[],[],[],['Command-line tool'],2.0,,iEnhancer-ECNN,,3807.0,2396.0,3242.6

In viruses, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are essential for their life cycle. Recognizing viral PTMs is very important for a better understanding of the mechanism of viral infections and finding potential drug targets. However, few studies have investigated the roles of viral PTMs in virus-human interactions using comprehensive viral PTM datasets. To fill this gap, we developed the first comprehensive viral posttranslational modification database (VPTMdb) for collecting systematic information of PTMs in human viruses and infected host cells. The VPTMdb contains 1240 unique viral PTM sites with 8 modification types from 43 viruses (818 experimentally verified PTM sites manually extracted from 150 publications and 422 PTMs extracted from SwissProt) as well as 13 650 infected cells' PTMs extracted from seven global proteomics experiments in six human viruses","['Small molecules', 'Bioinformatics', 'Proteomics', 'Sequence sites, features and motifs', 'Protein modifications']","['PTM site prediction', 'PTM localisation', 'Protein disorder prediction']",[],[],[],0.0,,vptmdb,,3807.0,1862.0,3029.0

In this paper, we proposed a novel method, named GO2Vec, that exploits graph embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from GO graph.

The extent to which a structure contains unusual configurations can then be judged from this fingerprint.

ScaleQC,0.167,"A Scalable Lossy to Lossless Solution for NGS Sequencing Data Compression.

Per-base quality values in NGS sequencing data take a significant portion of storage even after compression. Lossy compression technologies could further reduce the space used by quality values. However, in many applications lossless compression is still desired. Hence, sequencing data in multiple file formats have to be prepared for different applications. Results We developed a scalable lossy to lossless compression solution for quality values named ScaleQC. ScaleQC is able to provide bit-stream level scalability. More specifically, the losslessly compressed bit-stream by ScaleQC can be further truncated to lower data rates without re-encoding. Despite its scalability, ScaleQC still achieves same or better compression performance at both lossless and lossy data rates compared to the state-of-the-art lossless or lossy compressors","['Statistics and probability', 'Sequencing']","['Standardisation and normalisation', 'Parsing', 'Splitting']",[],[],[],0.0,,scaleqc,,3807.0,1862.0,3029.0

Current automatic approaches extract associations by considering each abstract or sentence independently. This approach could potentially lead to contradictions between individual cases.

Abstract Computational prediction of bioactivity has become a critical aspect of modern drug discovery as it mitigates the cost, time, and resources required to find and screen new compounds. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have recently shown excellent performance in modeling Protein-Ligand Interaction (PLI). However, DNNs are only effective when physically sound descriptions of ligands and proteins are fed into the network for further processing. Furthermore, previous research has not incorporated the secondary structure of the protein in a meaningful manner. In this work, we utilize secondary structure information of the protein which is extracted as the curvature and torsion of the backbone of protein to predict PLI.

This paper presents a new method, ERINS, to detect nsINS contents and genotypes of full spectrum range size. It integrates the features of structural variations and mapping states of split reads to find nsINS breakpoints, and then adopts a left-most mapping strategy to infer nsINS content by iteratively extending the standard reference at each breakpoint. Finally, it realigns all reads to the extended reference and infers nsINS genotypes through statistical testing on read counts.

PPR-SSM,0.167,"personalized PageRank and semantic similarity measures for entity linking.

BACKGROUND:Biomedical literature concerns a wide range of concepts, requiring controlled vocabularies to maintain a consistent terminology across different research groups. However, as new concepts are introduced, biomedical literature is prone to ambiguity, specifically in fields that are advancing more rapidly, for example, drug design and development. Entity linking is a text mining task that aims at linking entities mentioned in the literature to concepts in a knowledge base. For example, entity linking can help finding all documents that mention the same concept and improve relation extraction methods. Existing approaches focus on the local similarity of each entity and the global coherence of all entities in a document, but do not take into account the semantics of the domain. RESULTS:We propose a method, PPR-SSM, to link entities found in documents to concepts from domain-specific ontologies","['Ontology and terminology', 'Data mining', 'Imaging', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Natural language processing']","['Relation extraction', 'Named-entity and concept recognition', 'Text annotation', 'Editing']",[],[],[],2.0,,PPR-SSM,,3807.0,2396.0,3242.6

There has been a significant improvement in protein residue contact prediction in recent years. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art methods still show deficiencies in the contact prediction of proteins with low-homology information. These top methods depend largely on statistical features that derived from homologous sequences, but previous studies, along with our analyses, show that they are insufficient for inferencing an accurate contact map for nonhomology protein targets. To compensate, we proposed a brand new single-sequence-based contact predictor (SSCpred) that performs prediction through the deep fully convolutional network (Deep FCN) with only the target sequence itself, i.e., without additional homology information. The proposed pipeline makes good use of the target sequence by utilizing the pair-wise encoding technique and Deep FCN","['Protein targeting and localisation', 'Workflows', 'Sequencing']","['Ab initio structure prediction', 'Residue contact prediction', 'Network analysis']",[],[],[],0.0,,sscpred,,3124.0,1862.0,2619.2

Hence, sometimes the effort of reimplementing scientific tools in Spark or Hadoop can't be sustained by research groups.

However, sharing and combining distributed genomic data to increase the sample size is often challenging or even impossible due to privacy concerns and privacy protection laws such as the GDPR. While meta-analysis has been established as an effective approach to combine summary statistics of several GWAS, its accuracy can be attenuated in the presence of cross-study heterogeneity.

Abstract Motivation With Next Generation Sequencing becoming more affordable every year, NGS technologies asserted themselves as the fastest and most reliable way to detect Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV) and Copy Number Variations (CNV) in cancer patients. These technologies can be used to sequence DNA at very high depths thus allowing to detect abnormalities in tumor cells with very low frequencies. A lot of different variant callers are publicly available and usually do a good job at calling out variants. However, when frequencies begin to drop under 1%, the specificity of these tools suffers greatly as true variants at very low frequencies can be easily confused with sequencing or PCR artifacts. The recent use of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) in NGS experiments offered a way to accurately separate true variants from artifacts.","['DNA polymorphism', 'Workflows', 'Sequencing']","['Variant filtering', 'Read mapping', 'Variant calling']",[],[],[],0.0,,umi-gen,MIT,3124.0,1862.0,2619.2

The rapid proliferation of low-cost RNA-seq data has resulted in a growing interest in RNA analysis techniques for various applications, ranging from identifying genotype-phenotype relationships to validating discoveries of other analysis results. However, many practical applications in this field are limited by the available computational resources and associated long computing time needed to perform the analysis. GATK has a popular best practices pipeline specifically designed for variant calling RNA-seq analysis. Some tools in this pipeline are not optimized to scale the analysis to multiple processors or compute nodes efficiently, thereby limiting their ability to process large datasets.

iScore offers simple solutions to classify protein-protein interfaces using a support vector machine approach on graph kernels. The simplest way to use iScore is through dedicated binaries that hide the complexity of the approach and allows access to the code with simple command line interfaces. The two binaries are iscore.train and iscore.predict that respectively train a model using a trainging set and use this model to predict the near-native character of unkown conformations.

ViSiElse was developed with the open-source software R to provide a solution for the complete visualization of the raw time data. Results.

Here we propose to address these challenges by developing a new versatile pipeline for macaque fMRI preprocessing. We developed a Python module, Pypreclin, to process raw images using state of the art algorithms embedded in a fully automatic pipeline. To evaluate its robustness, we applied Pypreclin to fMRI data acquired at 3T in both awake and anesthetized macaques, with or without iron oxide contrast agent, using single loop or multichannel phased-array coils, combined or not with intracranial implanted electrodes.","['Neurobiology', 'Medical imaging', 'Workflows', 'MRI']",[],[],[],[],2.0,,Pypreclin,,3124.0,2396.0,2832.8

Jasmine,0.117,"a Java pipeline for isomiR characterization in miRNA-Seq Data.

MOTIVATION:The existence of complex subpopulations of miRNA isoforms, or isomiRs, is well established. While many tools exist for investigating isomiR populations, they differ in how they characterize an isomiR, making it difficult to compare results across different tools. Thus, there is a need for a more comprehensive and systematic standard for defining isomiRs. Such a standard would allow investigation of isomiR population structure in progressively more refined sub-populations, permitting the identification of more subtle changes between conditions and leading to an improved understanding of the processes that generate these differences.

Abstract With the recent torrent of high throughput sequencing (HTS) data the necessity for highly efficient algorithms for common tasks is paramount. One task for which the basis for all further analysis of HTS data is initial data quality control, that is, the removal or trimming of poor quality reads from the dataset. Here we present QuAdTrim, a quality control and adapter trimming algorithm for HTS data that is up to 57 times faster and uses less than 0.06% of the memory of other commonly used HTS quality control programs. QuAdTrim will reduce the time and memory required for quality control of HTS data, and in doing, will reduce the computational demands of a fundamental step in HTS data analysis. Additionally, QuAdTrim impliments the removal of homopolymer Gs from the 3’ end of sequence reads, a common error generated on the NovaSeq, NextSeq and iSeq100 platforms",['Sequencing'],"['Sequence trimming', 'Primer removal', 'Sequencing quality control']",[],[],[],0.0,,QuAdTrim,BSD-3-Clause,945.0,1862.0,1311.8000000000002

While virtual screening can significantly enhance drug discovery workflow, it ultimately lags the current rate of expansion of chemical databases that already incorporate billions of purchasable compounds. This surge of available small molecules presents great opportunities for drug discovery but also demands for faster virtual screening methods and protocols. In order to address this challenge, we herein introduce Deep Docking ( D 2 ) - a novel deep learning-based approach which is suited for docking billions of molecular structures.","['Molecular biology', 'Drug discovery', 'Small molecules', 'Molecular modelling', 'Toxicology']",['Molecular docking'],[],[],"['Command-line tool', 'Workflow']",7.0,https://github.com/vibudh2209/D2/issues,Deep_Docking,MIT,945.0,2909.0,1730.6000000000001
Gene,0.083,"A curated transcriptome dataset collection to investigate inborn errors of immunity.

Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders, frequently caused by loss-of-function and less commonly by gain-of-function mutations, which can result in susceptibility to a broad or a very narrow range of infections but also in inflammatory, allergic or malignant diseases. Owing to the wide range in clinical manifestations and variability in penetrance and expressivity, there is an urgent need to better understand the underlying molecular, cellular and immunological phenotypes in PID patients in order to improve clinical diagnosis and management.

It has been proposed that retro-cues aid recall by transferring information from a high-capacity memory store into visual working memory (multiple-store hypothesis). Alternatively, retro-cues could aid recall by redistributing memory resources within the same (low-capacity) working memory store (single-store hypothesis). If retro-cues provide access to a memory store with a capacity exceeding the set size, then, given sufficient training in the use of the retro-cue, near-ceiling performance should be observed","['Neurobiology', 'Human biology']","['Statistical calculation', 'Modelling and simulation', 'Visualisation']",[],[],['Command-line tool'],0.0,,retro-cues,GPL-3.0,945.0,1862.0,1311.8000000000002

The first involves retrieving Y-contigs using proportion sharing with a female, but such a strategy is prone to false positives in the absence of a high-quality, complete female reference. A second strategy uses the ratio of depth of coverage from male and female reads to select Y-contigs, but such a method requires high-depth sequencing of a female and cannot utilize existing female references.
