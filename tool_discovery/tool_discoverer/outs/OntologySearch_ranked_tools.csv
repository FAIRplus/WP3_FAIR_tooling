PPR-SSM,0.688,"personalized PageRank and semantic similarity measures for entity linking.

BACKGROUND:Biomedical literature concerns a wide range of concepts, requiring controlled vocabularies to maintain a consistent terminology across different research groups. However, as new concepts are introduced, biomedical literature is prone to ambiguity, specifically in fields that are advancing more rapidly, for example, drug design and development. Entity linking is a text mining task that aims at linking entities mentioned in the literature to concepts in a knowledge base. For example, entity linking can help finding all documents that mention the same concept and improve relation extraction methods. Existing approaches focus on the local similarity of each entity and the global coherence of all entities in a document, but do not take into account the semantics of the domain. RESULTS:We propose a method, PPR-SSM, to link entities found in documents to concepts from domain-specific ontologies","['Natural language processing', 'Imaging', 'Data mining', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Ontology and terminology']","['Editing', 'Named-entity and concept recognition', 'Text annotation', 'Relation extraction']",[],[],[],2.0,,PPR-SSM,,646.0,305.0,509.59999999999997

BACKGROUND:Semantic similarity between Gene Ontology (GO) terms is a fundamental measure for many bioinformatics applications, such as determining functional similarity between genes or proteins. Most previous research exploited information content to estimate the semantic similarity between GO terms; recently some research exploited word embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from a large-scale corpus. In this paper, we proposed a novel method, named GO2Vec, that exploits graph embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from GO graph. GO2Vec combines the information from both GO graph and GO annotations, and its learned vectors can be applied to a variety of bioinformatics applications, such as calculating functional similarity between proteins and predicting protein-protein interactions","['Machine learning', 'Model organisms', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Protein interactions']","['Protein interaction prediction', 'Standardisation and normalisation']",[],[],['Command-line tool'],4.0,,GO2Vec,GPL-3.0,554.0,354.0,474.0

A popular approach is to determine statistically overrepresented genes in a user-defined list through enrichment analysis tools, which rely on functional annotations of genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms.
