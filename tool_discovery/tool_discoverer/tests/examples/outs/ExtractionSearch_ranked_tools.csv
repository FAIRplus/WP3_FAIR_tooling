MySeq,1.000,"Privacy-protecting browser-based personal Genome analysis for genomics education and exploration.

MySeq is a web-application for privacy-protecting interactive analysis of personal genomes (distributed as compressed-and-indexed VCF files) inspired by GENOtation (previously the Interpretome) and DNA.LAND Compass. MySeq is intended for use as a genomics educational platform.

Analyzing the PTC Tasting Phenotype with MySeq.

This page is an example analysis of the ""bitter tasting"" trait using the MySeq application in an embedded context. Here MySeq is used to both query a whole genome VCF for NA12878 (from Genome in a Bottle) by genomic coordinates and predict the bitter tasting phenotype directly. All of the queries demonstrated here are performed ""live"" in the browser, that is these are not pre-generated results. Try MySeq as a ""standalone"" application.

Here, we describe our tool, SingleCellNet, which addresses these issues and enables the classification of query single-cell RNA-seq data in comparison to reference single-cell RNA-seq data.

REINDEER builds a data-structure that indexes k-mers and their abundances in a collection of datasets (raw RNA-seq or metagenomic reads for instance). Then, a sequence (FASTA) can be queried for its presence and abundance in each indexed dataset. While other tools (e.g. SBT, BIGSI) were also designed for large-scale k-mer presence/absence queries, retrieving abundances was so far unsupported (except for single datasets, e.g. using some k-mer counters like KMC, Jellyfish). REINDEER combines fast queries, small index size, and low memory footprint during indexing and queries. We showed it allows to index 2585 RNA-seq datasets (~4 billions k-mers) using less than 60GB of RAM and a final index size lower than 60GB on the disk. Then, a REINDEER index can either be queried on disk (experimental feature, low RAM usage) or be loaded in RAM for faster queries.","['RNA-Seq', 'Metagenomics', 'Proteomics experiment']","['k-mer counting', 'De-novo assembly', 'Quantification', 'Data retrieval', 'Genome indexing']",[],[],[],0.0,,reindeer,AGPL-3.0,1329.0,476.0,987.8

Current transfer-based ensemble attacks, however, only consider a limited number of source models to craft an adversarial example and, thus, obtain poor transferability. Besides, recent query-based black-box attacks, which require numerous queries to the target model, not only come under suspicion by the target model but also cause expensive query cost.

Here, we propose an approach based on principles of Service Oriented Architecture design, to allow the integrated management and analysis of multi-omics and biomedical imaging data.

Stomach cancer (SC) is a type of cancer, which is derived from the stomach mucous membrane. As there are non-specific symptoms or no noticeable symptoms observed at the early stage, newly diagnosed SC cases usually reach an advanced stage and are thus difficult to cure. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop an integrated database of SC. METHODS:SC-related genes were identified through literature mining and by analyzing the publicly available microarray datasets. Using the RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and clinical data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for all the SC-related genes were generated and analyzed.

Abstract High-throughput sequencing 16S rRNA gene surveys have enabled new insights into the diversity of soil bacteria, and furthered understanding of the ecological drivers of abundances across landscapes. However, current analytical approaches are of limited use in formalising syntheses of the ecological attributes of taxa discovered, because derived taxonomic units are typically unique to individual studies and sequence identification databases only characterise taxonomy. To address this, we used sequences obtained from a large nationwide soil survey (GB Countryside Survey, henceforth CS) to create a comprehensive soil specific 16S reference database, with coupled ecological information derived from the survey metadata.","['Sequencing', 'Taxonomy', 'Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA', 'Ecology', 'Informatics']","['Community profiling', 'Query and retrieval', 'Regression analysis']",[],[],['Web application'],0.0,,id-taxer,,1329.0,476.0,987.8

Per-base quality values in NGS sequencing data take a significant portion of storage even after compression. Lossy compression technologies could further reduce the space used by quality values. However, in many applications lossless compression is still desired. Hence, sequencing data in multiple file formats have to be prepared for different applications. Results We developed a scalable lossy to lossless compression solution for quality values named ScaleQC. ScaleQC is able to provide bit-stream level scalability. More specifically, the losslessly compressed bit-stream by ScaleQC can be further truncated to lower data rates without re-encoding. Despite its scalability, ScaleQC still achieves same or better compression performance at both lossless and lossy data rates compared to the state-of-the-art lossless or lossy compressors","['Sequencing', 'Statistics and probability']","['Parsing', 'Splitting', 'Standardisation and normalisation']",[],[],[],0.0,,scaleqc,,1329.0,476.0,987.8

To aid downstream analysis, DAStk also includes a graph that combines all human proteins in Uniprot, with their respective annotations, and all human Reactome data on biological pathways, biochemical reactions, and complex formation.

In this paper, we establish a new query-specific computational method, named I-LBR, for the identification of LBRs without directly using the information of protein 3D structure.

The majority of all proteins in cells interact with membranes either permanently or temporarily. Peripheral membrane proteins form transient complexes with membrane proteins and or lipids, via non-covalent interactions and are of outmost importance, due to numerous cellular functions in which they participate. In an effort to collect data regarding this heterogeneous group of proteins we designed and constructed a database, called PerMemDB. PerMemDB is currently the most complete and comprehensive repository of data for eukaryotic peripheral membrane proteins deposited in UniProt or predicted with the use of MBPpred - a computational method that specializes in the detection of proteins that interact non-covalently with membrane lipids, via membrane binding domains. The first version of the database contains 231,770 peripheral membrane proteins from 1009 organisms.","['Lipids', 'Literature and language', 'Model organisms', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein folds and structural domains']","['Query and retrieval', 'Deposition', 'Protein interaction prediction', 'Fold recognition']",[],[],[],1.0,,PerMemDB,,1329.0,576.0,1027.8
