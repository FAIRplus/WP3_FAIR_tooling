toff	"database of traits of fish to promote advances in fish aquaculture.

toff-project – Database of Traits OF Fish.

TOFF (i.e. Traits OF Fish) is a curated database focusing on functional trait information for fish that aims at bringing together behavioral, morphological, phenological, and physiological traits coupled to environmental measurement context into a single open-source access repository. TOFF hosts data from published field and experimental studies. We ultimately aim to provide an inclusive and accessible data resource to facilitate advances in fish research"	[]	[{'term': 'Model organisms', 'uri': 'http://edamontology.org/topic_0621'}, {'term': 'Database management', 'uri': 'http://edamontology.org/topic_3489'}, {'term': 'Physiology', 'uri': 'http://edamontology.org/topic_3300'}, {'term': 'Genotype and phenotype', 'uri': 'http://edamontology.org/topic_0625'}, {'term': 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'uri': 'http://edamontology.org/topic_0749'}]	[]	[]
