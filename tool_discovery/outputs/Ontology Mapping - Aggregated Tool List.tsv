OLS	1	Manual	Ontology management	Open Source	The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) is build in a collaborative, international effort and will serve as a resource for annotating biomedical investigations, including the study design, protocols and instrumentation used, the data generated and the types of analysis performed on the data. This ontology arose from the Functional Genomics Investigation Ontology (FuGO) and will contain both terms that are common to all biomedical investigations, including functional genomics investigations and those that are more domain specific.	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/obi		
OXO	1	Manual	Ontology mapping	Open Source	OxO is a service for finding mappings (or cross-references) between terms from ontologies, vocabularies and coding standards. OxO imports mappings from a variety of sources including the Ontology Lookup Service and a subset of mappings provided by the UMLS. We're still developing the service so please get in touch if you have any feedback.	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/oxo/		
Zooma	1	Manual	Text annotation	Open Source	Zooma is a tool for mapping free text annotations to ontology term based on a curated repository of annotation knowledge. Where mappings are not found in the curated respository one or more ontologies can be selected from the Ontology Lookup Service to increase coverage. For example if you want to map GWAS annotations select the GWAS datasource and a common disease ontology such as EFO or DOID to maximise coverage when terms have no curated mappings. Use the text box to find possible ontology mappings for free text terms in the ZOOMA repository of curated annotation knowledge. You can add one term (e.g. 'Homo sapiens') per line. If you also have a type for your term (e.g. 'organism'), put this after the term, separated by a tab. If you are new to ZOOMA, take a look at our getting started guide.	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/zooma/

NCBO bioportal Annotator	1	Manual	Text annotation	Open Source	The range of publicly available biomedical data is enormous and continues to rapidly expand. This expansion means that researchers now face a hurdle to extracting the data they need from the large numbers of data that are available. Biomedical researchers have turned to ontologies and terminologies to structure and annotate their data with ontology concepts for better search and retrieval. However, this annotation process cannot be easily automated and often requires expert curators. Plus, there is a lack of easy-to-use systems that facilitate the use of ontologies for annotation. The NCBO Annotator (formerly referred to as the Open Biomedical Annotator (OBA)) is an ontology-based Web service that annotates public datasets with biomedical ontology concepts based on their textual metadata. The biomedical community can use the annotator service to tag their data automatically with ontology concepts. These concepts come from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) BioPortal ontologies. Such annotations facilitate translational discoveries by integrating annotated data.	https://bioportal.bioontology.org/annotator

ppr-ssm	0.917	Automated	Entity and concept recognition	Open Source	personalized PageRank and semantic similarity measures for entity linking. BACKGROUND:Biomedical literature concerns a wide range of concepts, requiring controlled vocabularies to maintain a consistent terminology across different research groups. However, as new concepts are introduced, biomedical literature is prone to ambiguity, specifically in fields that are advancing more rapidly, for example, drug design and development. Entity linking is a text mining task that aims at linking entities mentioned in the literature to concepts in a knowledge base. For example, entity linking can help finding all documents that mention the same concept and improve relation extraction methods. Existing approaches focus on the local similarity of each entity and the global coherence of all entities in a document, but do not take into account the semantics of the domain. RESULTS:We propose a method, PPR-SSM, to link entities found in documents to concepts from domain-specific ontologies			https://bio.tools/ppr-ssm

anddigest	0.75	Automated	Ontology mapping	Open Source	A web-based module of ANDSystem for the search of knowledge in the scientific literature. The rapid growth of scientific literature has rendered the task of finding relevant information one of the critical problems in almost any research.

In contrast to the search engines, text-mining systems provide extraction of knowledge with representations in the form of semantic networks. Of particular interest are tools performing a full cycle of knowledge management and engineering, including automated retrieval, integration, and representation of knowledge in the form of semantic networks, their visualization, and analysis.
