ontology annotation,NCBO bioportal Annotator,"The range of publicly available biomedical data is enormous and continues to rapidly expand. This expansion means that researchers now face a hurdle to extracting the data they need from the large numbers of data that are available. Biomedical researchers have turned to ontologies and terminologies to structure and annotate their data with ontology concepts for better search and retrieval. However, this annotation process cannot be easily automated and often requires expert curators. Plus, there is a lack of easy-to-use systems that facilitate the use of ontologies for annotation. The NCBO Annotator (formerly referred to as the Open Biomedical Annotator (OBA)) is an ontology-based Web service that annotates public datasets with biomedical ontology concepts based on their textual metadata. The biomedical community can use the annotator service to tag their data automatically with ontology concepts. These concepts come from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) BioPortal ontologies. Such annotations facilitate translational discoveries by integrating annotated data.",https://bioportal.bioontology.org/annotator,,,,,

ontology annotation,Zooma,"Zooma is a tool for mapping free text annotations to ontology term based on a curated repository of annotation knowledge.

Where mappings are not found in the curated respository one or more ontologies can be selected from the Ontology Lookup Service to increase coverage. For example if you want to map GWAS annotations select the GWAS datasource and a common disease ontology such as EFO or DOID to maximise coverage when terms have no curated mappings.

Use the text box to find possible ontology mappings for free text terms in the ZOOMA repository of curated annotation knowledge. You can add one term (e.g. 'Homo sapiens') per line. If you also have a type for your term (e.g. 'organism'), put this after the term, separated by a tab.
