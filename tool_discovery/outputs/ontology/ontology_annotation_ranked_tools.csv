ppr-ssm,0.688,"personalized PageRank and semantic similarity measures for entity linking.

BACKGROUND:Biomedical literature concerns a wide range of concepts, requiring controlled vocabularies to maintain a consistent terminology across different research groups. However, as new concepts are introduced, biomedical literature is prone to ambiguity, specifically in fields that are advancing more rapidly, for example, drug design and development. Entity linking is a text mining task that aims at linking entities mentioned in the literature to concepts in a knowledge base. For example, entity linking can help finding all documents that mention the same concept and improve relation extraction methods. Existing approaches focus on the local similarity of each entity and the global coherence of all entities in a document, but do not take into account the semantics of the domain. RESULTS:We propose a method, PPR-SSM, to link entities found in documents to concepts from domain-specific ontologies","['Imaging', 'Natural language processing', 'Data mining', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Ontology and terminology']",[],2.0,,https://bio.tools/ppr-ssm,611.0,350.0,506.59999999999997

ROMOP is a flexible R package to interface with the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) OMOP Common Data Model. Briefly, OMOP is a standardized relational database schema for Electronic Health Record (EHR) or Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data (i.e., patient data collected during clinical visits to a health system). The main benefit of a standardized schema is that it allows for interoperability between institutions, even if the underlying EHR vendors are disparate.

BACKGROUND:Semantic similarity between Gene Ontology (GO) terms is a fundamental measure for many bioinformatics applications, such as determining functional similarity between genes or proteins. Most previous research exploited information content to estimate the semantic similarity between GO terms; recently some research exploited word embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from a large-scale corpus. In this paper, we proposed a novel method, named GO2Vec, that exploits graph embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from GO graph. GO2Vec combines the information from both GO graph and GO annotations, and its learned vectors can be applied to a variety of bioinformatics applications, such as calculating functional similarity between proteins and predicting protein-protein interactions","['Protein interactions', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Machine learning', 'Model organisms']",['Command-line tool'],1.0,,https://bio.tools/go2vec,528.0,338.0,452.0

Abstract Motivation The genetic mechanisms involved in human diseases are fundamental in biomedical research. Several databases with curated associations between genes and diseases have emerged in the last decades. Although, due to the demanding and time consuming nature of manual curation of literature, they still lack large amounts of information. Current automatic approaches extract associations by considering each abstract or sentence independently. This approach could potentially lead to contradictions between individual cases. Therefore, there is a current need for automatic strategies that can provide a literature consensus of gene-disease associations, and are not prone to making contradictory predictions","['Pathology', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Literature and language', 'GWAS study', 'Machine learning']",['Command-line tool'],0.0,,https://bio.tools/gedex,228.0,315.0,262.79999999999995
