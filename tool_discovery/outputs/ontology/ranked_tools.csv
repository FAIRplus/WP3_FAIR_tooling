ppr-ssm,0.917,"personalized PageRank and semantic similarity measures for entity linking.

BACKGROUND:Biomedical literature concerns a wide range of concepts, requiring controlled vocabularies to maintain a consistent terminology across different research groups. However, as new concepts are introduced, biomedical literature is prone to ambiguity, specifically in fields that are advancing more rapidly, for example, drug design and development. Entity linking is a text mining task that aims at linking entities mentioned in the literature to concepts in a knowledge base. For example, entity linking can help finding all documents that mention the same concept and improve relation extraction methods. Existing approaches focus on the local similarity of each entity and the global coherence of all entities in a document, but do not take into account the semantics of the domain. RESULTS:We propose a method, PPR-SSM, to link entities found in documents to concepts from domain-specific ontologies",,https://bio.tools/ppr-ssm

go2vec,0.333,"transforming GO terms and proteins to vector representations via graph embeddings.

BACKGROUND:Semantic similarity between Gene Ontology (GO) terms is a fundamental measure for many bioinformatics applications, such as determining functional similarity between genes or proteins. Most previous research exploited information content to estimate the semantic similarity between GO terms; recently some research exploited word embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from a large-scale corpus. In this paper, we proposed a novel method, named GO2Vec, that exploits graph embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from GO graph. GO2Vec combines the information from both GO graph and GO annotations, and its learned vectors can be applied to a variety of bioinformatics applications, such as calculating functional similarity between proteins and predicting protein-protein interactions",,https://bio.tools/go2vec

Current automatic approaches extract associations by considering each abstract or sentence independently. This approach could potentially lead to contradictions between individual cases. Therefore, there is a current need for automatic strategies that can provide a literature consensus of gene-disease associations, and are not prone to making contradictory predictions",,https://bio.tools/gedex
